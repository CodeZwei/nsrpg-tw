:: Cottage

You stand in a cosy, rustic Cottage. There is a cooking pot on the fire and a small bed and desk by the window.
A young woman dressed in a black robe and Witchs' hat sits at the desk reading from a large leather-bound tomb.
She looks up and smiles as you approach.

You may approach the [[Witch|Witch Encounter]].
Or You may [[Return|South Road]] to the South Road.
