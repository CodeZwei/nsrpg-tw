:: Dungeon Entrance

TODO: Only show this segment the first time you enter this region
You hear the heavy iron door close and lock behind you. The guards grumble as they move away.

You stand alone at the top of a stair case leading to the tower dungeon. It is dimmly illuminated by torch light.
You are dressed in tattered rags which barely conceal your perky breasts and olive skin.

The only way forward is deeper into the [[Dungeon|Floor 1 Entrance]].
